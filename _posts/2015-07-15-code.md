This theme implements a built-in Jekyll feature, the use of Rouge, for syntax highlighting.
It supports more than 100 languages.
This example is in C++.
All you have to do is wrap your code in a liquid tag:

The keyword `linenos` triggers display of line numbers.
Produces something like this:

{% highlight python %}

class TestClass:
  def __init__(self):
    pass

{% endhighlight %}
