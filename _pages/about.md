I'm a Ph.D. student at the [Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.bosch-ai.com/) and the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/)
working on Natural Language Processing – specifically, how to leverage grammatical structures to extract information from scientific writing.

Before starting my Ph.D., I obtained a Bachelors degree in Computational Linguistics and a Masters degree in Informatics, and I completed a one-year general studies program
at the [Leibniz Kolleg](https://www.leibniz-kolleg.uni-tuebingen.de/) in Tübingen. 

Currently, I am working on syntactic dependency parsing and how to apply its methods to to other NLP tasks. If you have questions or otherwise want to get in touch,
don't hesitate to send me an email!
