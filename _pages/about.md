I am a Senior Data Scientist for AI Enabling at the [Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.bosch-ai.com/), providing training and mentoring on industrial AI, machine learning, and data science projects.
Simultaneously, I am working towards a Ph.D. degree in Natural Language Processing at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/) – specifically, how to leverage grammatical structures to extract information from scientific writing.

Before starting my Ph.D., I obtained a Masters degree in Informatics ([University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics)) and a Bachelors degree in Computational Linguistics ([Saarland University](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/)), and completed a one-year general studies program at the [Leibniz Kolleg](https://www.leibniz-kolleg.uni-tuebingen.de/) in Tübingen.

My main area of interest and expertise is Natural Language Processing, particularly language models and neural models for structured prediction in NLP. If you have questions or otherwise want to get in touch, please don't hesitate to send me an email!
