I am a Senior Data Scientist for AI Enabling at the [Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.bosch-ai.com/), providing training and mentoring on Industrial AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science projects.

Previously, I have obtained Ph.D. degree in Natural Language Processing at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/) on syntactic parsing and information extraction from scientific writing.
I also hold a Masters degree in Informatics ([University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics)) and a Bachelors degree in Computational Linguistics ([Saarland University](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/)), and I have completed a one-year general studies program at the [Leibniz Kolleg](https://www.leibniz-kolleg.uni-tuebingen.de/) in TÃ¼bingen.

My main area of interest and expertise is Natural Language Processing, particularly language models and neural networks for structured prediction in NLP. If you have questions or otherwise want to get in touch, please don't hesitate to send me an email!
